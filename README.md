# KUKA_YouBot_Project

The aim of this project is to catch the flying object (ball) thrown by the user using the basket mounted at the TCP of the Kuka YouBot arm. Computer vision for the Kinect Camera was used for ball detection and tracking. A path prediction algorithm was implemented for estimating the lading coordinates of the ball. A Baumer camera along with the ArUco marker was used to track the robot along with the basket. For robot programming, wrapper APIs of the Kuka YouBot was used.

This project was implemented using various concepts of object-oriented programming in C++.
